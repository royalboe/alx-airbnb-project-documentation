# 📘 Airbnb Clone – User Stories

This directory documents the user stories for the **Airbnb Clone backend project**. The user stories are derived from the project requirements and the system use case diagram. They represent core interactions that users (guests, hosts, admins) will have with the system and guide the design of backend features and API endpoints.

## 📄 What Are User Stories?

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer. They follow the format:

> *As a [user type], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].*

These stories help developers, designers, and stakeholders maintain a shared understanding of system functionalities.
