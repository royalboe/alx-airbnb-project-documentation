## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This documentation was thoughtfully developed by me as part of the **ALX Airbnb Clone Project**.

💡 I practiced my **AI prompting skills** by working with **ChatGPT** to generate and structure the content of this README and use case details.

Thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for the helpful assistance in translating system requirements into structured documentation and diagrams.
